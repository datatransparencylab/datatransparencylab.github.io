				<p class="left-aligned">The Data Transparency Lab is a collaborative effort between universities, businesses and institutions to support research in tools, data, and methodologies for shedding light on the use of personal data by online services, and to empower users to be in control of their personal data online. DTL will award in 2017 up to 6 research grants as well as up to 3 postdoc positions to support the work of applicants from academic institutions worldwide.			
						</p>
		
		
		<h4>Grant Awards</h4>
<br>
		<p class="left-aligned">The grants come in the form of a lump sum of up to 50K Euro that will be awarded to successful applicants for pursuing research that will lead to the development of transparency software tools for end users, interest groups, regulation authorities, and governments. The following list of topics provides several examples of tools that we are looking to support. In this third year of the program we are particularly interested in tools for detecting algorithmic bias and discrimination as well as in tools for exposing location and other IoT related privacy threats. </p>

		<p class="left-aligned">Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

		         <p class="left-aligned">Successful applicants are expected to present their results in the annual DTL Conference, make their software available online (the latest 12 months after receiving the grant), and acknowledge the funding source. Reporting obligations will be minimal and successful applicants will be eligible to apply for additional follow up funding to further curate their tool. Proposals will be selected based on their novelty and their commitment to develop and deploy tools. Proposals that propose a research project without implementation of a prototype/tool won’t be considered (the postdoc program -see below- should then be considered). Proposals already funded by other sources won’t be considered.</p>

									The grants are aimed towards supporting fully or partly the work of a Principal Investigator (PI) and at least one PhD student or postdoc for a period of approximately a year. Ideally, they should produce software tools and platforms that enable end-users to better understand or control how their personal information is being collected and used in deployed online services. 
								</p>

									Successful applicants are expected to present their results in the annual DTL workshop and acknowledge the funding source but beyond that there is no other reporting obligation.
