    One of the main aims DTL has is providing insights about the use of our
    personal data. One of 2015 Grantees, <a href="http://recon.meddle.mobi/"> 
    project ReCon </a> offers a tool to end-users that let them understand
    which bits of Personal Information (PI) are sent by their smartphones. In
    particular, this tool details the type of Personal Information is sent,
    which applications are sending it and which domains are receiving it.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the key insights ReCon project unveiled, was that 
    <a href="/news/2016/03/03/choffcasespassword.html"> some applications were 
    sending users' passwords in plain text </a> (i.e. not encrypted). By
    detecting this situation and contacting the application developers, most of
    the app developers fixed the situation. What is interesting about this, is
    that the insight we discovered was not only useful to ReCon users, but it
    was also extremely useful to any user of the spotted applications as
    because of the findings, new application versions (sending the passwords
    encrypted) were released.
  </p>
  <p>
    In summary, every tool that DTL develops, benefits the end users of the
    tool directly, but it's also benefitial to many other users, in this case,
    probably millions of users, that although were not using ReCon tool, were
    affected by the same vulnerabilities. That made me wonder how could we
    make the most of the projects we were running, and in particular ReCon.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first approach that came to my mind was sharing all the Personal 
    Information leaks detected openly, so any user could look for information
    about how a particular application behaves privacy-wise. I decided to
    explore the possibility to develop a visualization of the PI leaks detected
    by the ReCon project. I shared this idea with ReCon Principal Investigator
    (Dave Choffnes) and he was very supportive, so we started working together
    to make it happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    ReCon team started to share with me a 
    <a href="http://recon.meddle.mobi/json/data.json">json file </a> that 
    included the aggregated information about PI leaks detected by ReCon so I
    already had a good starting point to play with. With the help of my 
    colleagues Blanca and Rafa we developed a first version of the
    visualization that you can play with at the 
    <a href="/tools/recon/index.html" target="_blank"> DTL
    Website</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a very early version, developed by a colour blind engineer, with no
    expertise in visualization, but despite that, is interesting as some 
    findings could be easily spotted: e.g. some applications sending the device
    identifier up to 9 different domains. In order to make this visualization
    more attractive and understandable to end-users we are working with 
    visualization experts to get better, nicer and more meaningful for 
    end-users visualizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://recon.meddle.mobi/json/data.json"> JSON file </a> and
    the <a href="https://github.com/datatransparencylab/recon/tree/gh-pages">
    source code </a> of the initial visualizations are fully available, so feel
    free to play with it, send us your Pull Requests or create a totally 
    brand new visualization.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also thought that there was some extra-value beyond a nice visualization
    of the data discovered by providing real-time interactive applications that
    can leverage ReCon findings. For instance, it could be interesting for an 
    end-user a mobile application that warns her about which PI has been spotted
    being leaked by other users on the apps her smartphone has installed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to address this kind of use of cases we decided to develop an API
    on top of the Dataset gathered by ReCon. Such an API could be used, for
    instance, to detect whether a particular app has been spotted leaking
    Personal Information before or not. This could be useful to identify how
    "leaking" a device is or to provice advise to the users before installing 
    an application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The API is alpha status but it's freely and openly available. The <a
    href="https://github.com/datatransparencylab/recon-api"> documentation </a>
    provides information about how to use the API and there are some <a
    href="https://github.com/datatransparencylab/recon-api"> slides </a> that
    provide more general context beyond the API.
