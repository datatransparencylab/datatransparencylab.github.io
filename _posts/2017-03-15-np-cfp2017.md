<p>The Data Transparency Lab (DTL) opens the call for its Grants Program 2017. For the third year, the DTL Grants Program wants to support research and user empowerment in the fields of data transparency and privacy online. </p>

<p>The DTL is an initiative supported by Telefónica, AT&T, Mozilla, INRIA & MIT Connection Science that will award in its third edition up to 6 research grants of up to 50,000€ each, to projects that can lead to the development of transparency software tools for end users, interest groups, regulation authorities, and governments. The call for proposals wants to focus in the areas of detection of algorithmic bias and discrimination as well as in the exposure of location and other IoT-related privacy threats. The grants are aimed towards supporting fully or partly the work of a Principal Investigator (PI) and at least one PhD student or post-doc for approximately a year. All the applicants need to clearly describe what their software tool can do, who can benefit from it, what is the novelty and technical excellence of the proposal and justify their expertise in that area.</p>

<p>For research projects with a longer scope and horizon, DTL will also offer up to 3 post-doc positions hosted at INRIA, Queen Mary University of London and other academic affiliates of DTL. </p>

<p>The call for proposals opens on March 15th and the deadline for submission is May, 10th. Successful applicants are expected to present their results in the annual DTL Conference, to be held in November 2017 in Paris, and make their software available online 12 months after receiving the grant at the latest. 	
</p>

<p>The projects will be reviewed by a committee of 25 representatives from leading academic institutions, companies, regulators, and government agencies (for full list see the call for proposals below). The committee will by chaired by Dr Claude Castelluccia, Senior Research Scientist at INRIA, and Dr Nikolaos Laoutaris, Chief Scientist at Telefónica. The committee will announce the awarded projects on June 15th, 2017. </p>
