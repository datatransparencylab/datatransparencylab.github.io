<span style="font-style:italic;">Barcelona, Spain </span>— <a href="http://www.datatransparencylab.org/">The Data Transparency Lab</a> (DTL) has launched its second annual Call for Proposals, part of the DTL <a href="http://www.datatransparencylab.org/grants-program.html">Grants Program</a>. In order to support research to foster data transparency, DTL will award research grants to academic institutions worldwide.

Our 2016 grant awardees will be announced early June 2016, and <a href="http://www.dtlconferences.org/"> will present their ongoing work at the DTL2016 Conference</a>, which will take place on Nov. 17-19th at Columbia University (New York City).</p>
