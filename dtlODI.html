    <h4>Data Transparency Lab + Open Data Institute</h4>
    <p>Data has the potential to provide
       valuable insight to improve our lives as individuals and our societies. The Open Data Institute (ODI) is catalysing the evolution of open data culture to create economic, environmental, and social value. The ODI believes that there is huge value to be derived
       from the ethical usage of aggregate personal data, but that personal data is never open by default.
    </p>
    <p>A pillar of the Data Transparency Lab (DTL) is the preservation of 
       people's trust in how their data is used online. DTL aims to generate 
       knowledge and tools to improve transparency around how personal data 
       is accessed and used by others, and establish best practices for sharing
       of personal data. The ODI joined the DTL community because it believes 
       that the power of open data is closely linked to the preservation of this
       trust.
     </p>
     <p>By joining the DTL community, the ODI seeks to explore how open data can
       contribute to increased transparency and awareness of how personal data 
       is being accessed and used.
