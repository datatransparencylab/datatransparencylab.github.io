            Floodwatch is a Chrome extension that can be downloaded from 
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/floodwatch/lnnmlfhgefcbnolklnepapefmmobedld">
              Chrome Store </a>. This extension tracks the ads you see as you 
            browse the Internet and helps you understand both the volume and the 
            types of ads youâ€™re being served during the course of normal 
            browsing. The goal is increasing awareness of how advertisers 
            track your browsing behavior, build their version of your online 
            identity, and target their ads to you as an individual.

          <p>
            This tool provides information about the measurements performed on 
            1 million web sites. The measurements were focused on identifying
            the tracking techniques used by those websites, both stateful 
            (cookie-based) and stateless (fingerprinting-based). The tool can 
            be used to check which tracking techniques are used by a given 
            website or to check how widely used a given tracking technology is.
            This tool has been developed by Princeton University, which 
            was awarded with one of the 2015 DTL Grants.

            This tool shows users what information is being sent by mobile
            applications to third parties, including understanding how companies
            are tracking their movements in their day-to-day life.
            ReCon detects device/user identifiers used in tracking, geolocation
            leaks, unsafe password transmissions, and personal information such
            as name, address, gender, and relationship status. This information
            is available to users via a private Web page, and ReCon allows them
            to provide feedback on whether important leaks have been found, and
            whether the leak should be blocked or the information sent modified.
