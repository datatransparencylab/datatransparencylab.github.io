      <!-- DTL Technical Program is intended to connect the key stakeholders that 
      are part of the Data Transparency Landscape: individuals, researchers, 
      industry players, policy makers, and other stakeholders. 
      Our ultimate target is ensuring the right tools to create awareness are 
      available so that an open and informed conversation around the usage of 
      online personal data can take place. -->

        <h4>Data Sharing </h4>
        <div class="column-divider-line"></div>
        <p> 
          In order to start formulating hypothesis, a starting point is 
          required (e.g. some data) so DTL provides a framework to 
          encourage sharing datasets so the entire scientific community 
          could benefit from them.

        <p>
          We are fostering an open source community around projects focused on 
          data transparency so that anyone (other developers, companies, policy
          makers...) can make the most of them or contribute back to them.

          We support the design and development of tools that let the users 
          understand what happens with their personal data. This is achieved
          via direct sponshorship, technical support, access to tools and 
          infrastructure...

    <h3>Tool Curation and Incubation</h3>

          <p>
           Many independent developers and research institutes might have very
           good ideas that can be launched as small research projects. However,
           in order to make those projects hit the mass market, they need extra
           support in terms of infrastructure, tooling or technical support. 
           DTL aims to support some of these tools so they can move from 
           small independent projects to commercial grade ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, some companies or organisations are already working 
            in many tools to provide more light to how personal data is used. 
            DTL welcomes those tools and is willing to support these companies 
            in order to ensure it reaches as many users as possible and provide 
            them as much value as possible.

            Floodwatch is a Chrome extension that tracks the ads you see as you 
            browse the Internet. It helps you understand both the volume and the 
            types of ads youâ€™re being served during the course of normal 
            browsing, with the goal of increasing awareness of how advertisers 
            track your browsing behavior, build their version of your online 
            identity, and target their ads to you as an individual.

            $heriff is an experimental service that allows to search for traces of
            price discrimination in the Internet. It let users knows whether 
            e-retailers vary their prices dynamically based on the information 
            that they can collect online for the potential customer (such as her 
            location, browser/OS, incoming link, navigation history, etc.).

            This tool informs in real-time Internet end users regarding the 
            economic value that the personal information associated to their 
            browsing activity has generated. Due to the complexity of the 
            problem we narrow down the scope of this tool to FB in this project,
            i.e., inform FB users in real time of the value that they are 
            generating to FB.
