            Floodwatch is a Chrome extension that can be downloaded from

              Chrome Store </a>. This extension tracks the ads you see as you 
            browse the Internet and helps you understand both the volume and the 
            types of ads youâ€™re being served during the course of normal 
            browsing. The goal is increasing awareness of how advertisers 
            track your browsing behavior, build their version of your online 
            identity, and target their ads to you as an individual.
